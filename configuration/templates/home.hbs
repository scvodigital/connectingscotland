    <h1>Join the national movement to get everyone online</h1>
    <p>
      A new Â£5million programme will offer an internet connection and a laptop or tablet to vulnerable people who are not already online during the response to coronavirus.

      The connecting Scotland programme will connect 9,000 more people who are either considered at clinically high-
      risk themselves or have children who are vulnerable, so they can access services and support during the pandemic.
